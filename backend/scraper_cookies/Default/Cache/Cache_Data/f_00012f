00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,179
Welcome to another episode of NASA

2
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,499
Science Live. An opportunity for you

3
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:52,419
to interact with NASA experts and

4
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,339
have your questions answered in real

5
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:57,299
time. I'm your host, Tahira Allen and

6
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,219
today, we're joining you live from

7
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,899
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center

8
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,179
in Greenbelt, Maryland.

9
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:34,499
One year ago today, the James Webb

10
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:36,339
Space Telescope released its first

11
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:39,299
full color images and data and had us

12
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,619
all in awe at the beauty of the

13
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,379
universe. As the world's most

14
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,539
powerful infrared space telescope,

15
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:47,699
Webb has been examining every phase

16
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:50,259
of cosmic history. From the first

17
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,739
luminous glows of galaxies in the

18
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,059
early universe, to the evolution of

19
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,859
galaxies, as well as stars, planets,

20
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,779
and objects in our own solar system.

21
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,319
We're going to highlight some of

22
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,079
Webb's exciting discoveries over

23
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,239
the past year. Get a look at what's

24
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,399
next for this historic mission and

25
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,839
answer your questions throughout

26
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,999
the show. Send in your questions

27
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,759
using the# ask NASA on social media or

28
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,599
drop them directly into the comment

29
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,159
box wherever you're watching. I'm

30
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,319
joined today by two astronomers who

31
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,479
are going to guide us through Webb's

32
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,719
first year in Science. Doctor Jane

33
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,159
Rigby, who is the Webb's senior

34
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,779
project scientist at NASA Goddard as

35
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:33,179
well as Doctor Makarena Garcia Marin

36
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:35,499
who is a web deputy project scientist

37
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,339
at the Space Telescope Science

38
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,179
Institute and a member of the

39
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:41,419
European Space Agency. Thank you

40
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,659
both so much for being here with us on

41
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,619
such a big day. So if you could just

42
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,219
start by telling us a little bit about

43
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,299
your roles on the mission and then how

44
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,939
you're just you're feeling today. By

45
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,539
all means, so thank you so much for

46
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,619
having us. Uh I've been part of the

47
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:58,859
mission for about 16 years and

48
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,299
throughout those years, I have had

49
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,059
different roles. Right now, I'm the

50
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,659
deputy parascientist for Space

51
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,099
Telescope and Science Institute and

52
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,499
that means that I interact with the

53
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,579
community. I oversee that things are

54
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,739
working as expected and really try to

55
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,099
give them what they need to publish

56
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,659
great science. How I feel today, it's

57
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,939
incredibly happy for this

58
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,459
accomplishment. The first year has

59
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,739
been fantastic really and this is a

60
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,739
testament to everybody who work on

61
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,099
the mission. So, we have three

62
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,179
agencies, NASA, ISA, the Canadian

63
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,739
Space Agency, 13 countries and 20,

64
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,219
000 people to make this happen. So,

65
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,539
it's really it is amazing. Amazing.

66
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,999
Yeah. For one telesco Oh, wow and what

67
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,239
about you, Jane? Sure. So, as the

68
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,519
senior project scientist, my my job

69
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,479
is to optimize the science that we do

70
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,199
with this amazing telescope to make

71
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,479
sure that we are doing the best

72
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,839
science and giving the community

73
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,399
what we need to really make this

74
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,839
transformative discoveries and

75
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,199
then to make sure we're explaining

76
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,919
those and sharing them with with the

77
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,879
world. Uh how I'm feeling today is so

78
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,399
proud of the team. People have worked

79
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,459
pour their hearts and their souls

80
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,099
into this mission and we also are you

81
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,939
know it's so gratifying to see how

82
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,779
many people around the world are with

83
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,419
us on that journey. It's been such a

84
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,419
wonderful year and I know that we

85
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,139
really are just getting started in

86
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,379
terms of the scientific return from

87
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,499
this telescope. I mean like we have so

88
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:30,419
much to get into today. That's we are

89
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,819
just. Let's go. So honored to have you

90
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,619
all. So over the past year, Webb has

91
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:37,779
provided new understandings of how

92
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,699
stars and their accompanying

93
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,819
planets form. Morning, a brand-new

94
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,979
image was released in celebration of

95
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,459
one year of web science operations.

96
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,699
It shows us a detailed view of the

97
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,459
closest star forming region to

98
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,699
Earth, the row of Fioki Cloud

99
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,899
Complex. Maca, this image just

100
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,259
practically begs for an

101
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,259
explanation. Could you start by just

102
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,339
telling us exactly what are we seeing

103
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,139
here by all means and I always like to

104
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,739
take a second to really take in the

105
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,339
image because it is really

106
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:10,499
astonishingly beautiful. It has a

107
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:12,159
structure it has this organic

108
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:13,999
feeling to it. It's really amazing

109
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,959
And yes, it is which is the closest

110
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,119
stuff for me region to us. And in this

111
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,399
case, we're looking at the region

112
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,879
with about 50 stars. For the most

113
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,319
part, they are very similar to the

114
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,639
sun. They are in terms of mass. And

115
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,079
they are essentially information.

116
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,879
They're just baby stars. So nursery.

117
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,119
It is like a nursery of a stars and even

118
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,039
though it is beautiful and has all

119
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,399
these structures and it's very,

120
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,399
there's a lot of activity going on. It

121
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,099
is actually quite a relax for a star

122
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,099
from the region. So Jay, why don't you

123
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,299
walk us through some of the details?

124
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,539
Sure. There's a lot to see. Let's go on

125
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,939
a little tour. Tour. Yeah. Let's do

126
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,339
it. Right? Okay. So, as we're looking

127
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,739
at the star farming region, one of the

128
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:55,819
first things that catches your eye is

129
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,779
the sort of glowing, mean down in the

130
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,939
bottom, the sort of yellow lion's

131
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,579
mane thing. What that is, is a massive

132
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,979
star is a little bit more massive than

133
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,139
the sun that has gotten out of its

134
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,359
birth cloud. We also have regions

135
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,039
that are still this where the stars

136
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,639
are still in their birth cloud. They

137
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,719
haven't gotten out yet. And we can see

138
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:18,359
their their glow of their discs as

139
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,799
they're accreding matter onto onto

140
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:25,319
the star. The you know it takes a while

141
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,879
for stars to form. They form out of a

142
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,879
disk of of gas and dust. And as there

143
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,559
it's just gravity. Right? It's just

144
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,639
gravity creating and then there's

145
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,399
more gravity so then more stuff gets

146
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,679
in. And then once the stars get once

147
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,999
the stars get enough mass to start

148
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:46,079
shining. Mm hmm. They can push back at

149
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,559
the clouds where they formed and so

150
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,759
you can get like that beautiful

151
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,719
ghostly lit up structure where it's

152
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,479
actually that that host that star

153
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,279
lighting up its birth cloud. We also

154
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,959
have the the colors here are really

155
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,359
important that yellow is dust that's

156
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,759
been lit up. That red is molecular

157
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,079
hydrogen. It's hydrogen that is

158
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,119
coming from jets being spat out in

159
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,799
these little by conical. These

160
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,959
little two jets getting shot out of

161
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,339
each of these new stars and so all

162
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,739
together, we have, it really is like a

163
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,219
nursery where the youngest stars

164
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:21,979
haven't haven't really gotten born

165
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,459
yet but they're far along and then,

166
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,379
right? They're they're along the

167
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,539
path and then the older ones are out,

168
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:30,619
they're shining, and they're having

169
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:33,179
an impact on the the region where they

170
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:35,899
were born. Well, I mean, we've been,

171
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,179
we've talked a little bit about

172
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:39,259
Stellar Birth right now, right? So.

173
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,179
Yes. Let's skip to the end of the

174
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,539
movie. You know, like, what happens

175
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,799
at the end of a life cycle for a star

176
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,839
like our son. So, everything in a star

177
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,599
depends on the mass, like the life and

178
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,199
the number of years that it will be in

179
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,959
the person of the in the case of a style

180
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,479
like the song. So, not so massive.

181
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:58,039
What it will happen is that when it's

182
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,479
nearing the end of its life, it will

183
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,079
start shedding the outer shelf and

184
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,759
creating this beautiful structures

185
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,119
around it which are called planetary

186
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:06,759
nebula and it will just take it lit up

187
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,079
and they are really developed detail

188
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,999
with web on this structure. It's

189
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,039
really fantastic. It's really

190
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,499
allows us to study of the fine detail

191
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,739
of the brighter enabler and so by the

192
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:20,179
end of it, the star will slowly sort of

193
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:21,699
switch off. It will become a white

194
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,379
orphan and then slowly switch off and

195
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,699
just you know, disappear and then we

196
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,019
have other type of stars that are

197
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,019
slightly more massive. Let's say

198
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,259
about like 30 solar masses and those

199
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:34,259
some of them are called warfare and

200
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,939
with Web, we have a study some

201
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:38,339
beautiful cases of warfare style

202
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,459
that are have like a companion

203
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,439
rotating around it. In that

204
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,439
rotation, it actually creates this

205
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,759
beautiful shells around it. So,

206
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,759
there was there's this case where you

207
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,159
have a sort of masters, the companion

208
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,999
and when they get close, the star

209
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,439
sheds because of the rapid

210
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:57,039
additional pool, shells of dust.

211
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,439
Every idea is one. It's like a tree

212
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,759
trunk of information. Yeah. It's

213
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,919
clockworking. You can yeah. Wow. You

214
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,599
can measure the time because it's

215
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,439
related with the way the stars rotate

216
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,879
around each other. So, it's truly

217
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,119
amazing and again, with Web, you can

218
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,739
study all the details and really see

219
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,099
many of these rains that have never

220
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,979
seen before in this in this level of

221
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:20,539
feature and and quality is amazing.

222
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,739
Wow. And this stars will end up like a

223
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,179
supernova and then we have the very

224
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:28,059
massive ones and what happens? After

225
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,099
a supernova. Sure. So, you know, so

226
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,339
with Web, we have been studying stars

227
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,419
that are close to dying like that Wolf

228
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:36,939
Ray star that's spinning out those

229
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,939
dust clouds and then we've also been

230
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,859
studying stars that are dead, that

231
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:43,099
have already exploded. Um that so

232
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,959
massive that have exploded as

233
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,439
Supernovi and in their dying, they

234
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,399
light up and blow up one of the

235
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,759
brightest explosions in the

236
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,399
universe and cast out these

237
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,999
fast-moving clouds of dust and gas

238
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,959
that have in them all of the

239
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,079
elements that get formed when a star

240
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,559
dies. It really is true. Crosshagan

241
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,239
used to say that we're all made of star

242
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:12,039
stuff. That is literally true. The

243
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,219
carbon oxy nitrogen, iron in our

244
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:18,099
bodies, were all made in stars. Many

245
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:19,939
of those elements are made in stars

246
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:22,579
when they blow up and so by studying

247
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,739
supernovi and their remnants, the

248
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,259
the gas, clouds that are left behind,

249
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,059
we can understand how the stuff we're

250
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:31,219
made of got formed in the hearts of

251
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:34,019
stars. And I mean, what just does such

252
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,179
a beautiful job appearing through

253
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:38,179
this dusk and like showing us things

254
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,939
we haven't seen before. So, this has

255
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,339
been really really phenomenal. Not

256
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:44,639
only just like visually but for the

257
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,759
science, this is. Science.

258
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,719
Incredible. Yeah. And so, many stars

259
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,559
have planets orbiting around them.

260
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,119
The ones outside our solar system are

261
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,999
called exoplanets. Maca, how how is

262
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:57,919
web studying exoplanets? So, I've

263
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,759
met the uses two techniques. One of

264
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,399
them is the direct imaging, taking a

265
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,919
picture of the planet and to do that,

266
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,879
you first have to block the star like

267
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,559
you know with your thumb and with the

268
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,799
sun. So, you block the star, close one

269
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,319
eye, and then you get the beautiful

270
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,979
image of the bread and next to it and

271
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,219
Webb has has demonstrated this can be

272
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:17,499
done beautifully and we are getting

273
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:19,579
data with this technique and then the

274
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,339
other technique is what we call a

275
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:22,379
planetary transit. So,

276
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,539
essentially, when a planet works its

277
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:26,299
way in the orbit in front of the star,

278
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,459
so we can measure the star before the

279
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,379
planet goes in front of it and when the

280
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,139
planet goes in front of like an

281
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,219
eclipse. So, in that in that process,

282
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:36,379
the light of the star gets filtered by

283
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,139
the planet atmosphere Mm hmm. And

284
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:39,659
then we can measure the atmosphere

285
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:41,659
composition of that planet. Thanks

286
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,799
to process of light filtering

287
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,439
through it. With web, the level of

288
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,679
high quality data we're getting with

289
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,279
this technique and stability and

290
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,519
really wealth of information. It's

291
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,119
it's you know, out of the chart. It

292
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:56,279
really is. Well, Jane, can you expand

293
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,799
a little bit on what we are learning

294
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,559
from these techniques say with

295
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,879
massive planets? Sure and now, we're

296
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,719
currently spending a quarter of all

297
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:05,959
the observing time with webs. Did you

298
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,839
plan that? Exoplanets. We asked for

299
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,759
the world's best ideas. Yeah. And

300
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,299
then we pick the best. Yeah. So, we can

301
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,539
respond to what good ideas people are

302
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,739
having but right now, people are

303
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,659
having a lot of ideas for studying

304
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,339
exoplanets. So, some of the

305
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,139
discoveries so far and again, with

306
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,619
so, for exoplanets, this was the big

307
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,939
uncertainty for us. Mm hmm. Web

308
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,259
wasn't built to do exoplanets. It was

309
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,099
originally designed to study the

310
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,019
most distant galaxies. We kind of

311
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,939
added that science case in kind of

312
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,699
late in the game. Slid that in. And it

313
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:38,979
was a, yeah, it was a little, well,

314
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:41,199
we'll see what we get. Yeah. Right? It

315
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:43,279
turns out the telescope has been so

316
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,439
stable. It has been gorgeous for

317
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,599
exoplanets and so the data that we're

318
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,399
getting of in which we're looking at

319
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,799
what the atmospheres around what

320
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,159
what's what's inside these

321
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,679
atmospheres of these planets

322
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,599
orbiting other stars and so the first

323
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:01,119
data we got on those exoplanets the

324
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,399
it basically just jumped out at us

325
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,119
like oh that's those that's the

326
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,039
fingerprint that's the signature of

327
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,119
molecular carbon dioxide. There it

328
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,559
is, right there. Well, that wasn't

329
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,239
hard. And then we took further

330
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:17,179
observations with other with other

331
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,419
modes of the observatory to get other

332
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,179
elements. And what's been so

333
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:22,859
wonderful with this telescope is

334
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:25,339
that before we had to strain to maybe

335
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:28,379
get one molecule maybe for some of

336
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:30,139
these planets. Instead we're

337
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,859
getting a whole soup. We're getting

338
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,939
water, carbon dioxide, sulfur

339
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,699
dioxide. We're getting what's going

340
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,459
on in there. What's the chemistry?

341
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,619
What's happening? So we're able to

342
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,979
understand what is going on in

343
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,959
inside these planets, What are they

344
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,119
like? And that's something we've

345
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,959
never been able to do before. And I

346
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,199
mean planets that are so far away,

347
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,919
right? Like these are hundreds of

348
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,679
light years away. Some of them, some

349
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,199
of them are really close, just a

350
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,359
couple of years away. Wow, that is

351
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,879
incredible. So, you know, we've

352
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,879
talked about massive planets right

353
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,279
now but as an earthling, you know, can

354
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,639
Web, can Webb study, you know, small

355
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,119
rocky planets like that as well. It's

356
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,699
gone and actually, there's very

357
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,139
well-known system which is a

358
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:16,979
trappist system. Mm hmm. And that has

359
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:21,059
seven planets within the Mercury

360
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,259
orbit for you to so it's a lot of

361
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,419
like you have the stars of the planets

362
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:27,859
packed into that very small orbit.

363
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:29,779
So, with where we're studying them

364
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,539
all, so far, we have ourselves for the

365
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,619
two ones closest to the stars. Uh huh.

366
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:35,139
And the results have been, well, they

367
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,259
don't have an atmosphere. We have

368
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,459
been able to measure the temperature

369
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,459
of one of them and there is a lot of

370
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:40,579
effort going on on the

371
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,819
characterization of the rest of the

372
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,719
planet it. So, what's everybody

373
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,719
wants to to find, I think, in this

374
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,719
case, for the rocky exoplanet is can

375
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:49,999
we find one that has that atmosphere.

376
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,799
So, it's all about keeping pushing

377
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,319
the boundaries and and getting more

378
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,159
and more data to get high-quality

379
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,999
results. So, Marco, could you, I

380
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,159
guess, help us understand what all

381
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,999
this means in the big scheme of

382
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:08,079
things, right? So, yeah. So, in the

383
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,239
nineties, we didn't know about other

384
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:12,879
exoplanets. Now, we know about that,

385
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,039
I mean, we have found about 5000 of

386
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,399
them. Yeah. So, it's all about

387
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,519
pushing the boundaries of our on how

388
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,999
our exoplanets form, what, what

389
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,199
types are there, how are the

390
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,719
atmospheres, like how the

391
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:27,039
atmospheres evolve and change with

392
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,119
time, It's all about putting in

393
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,799
context that planetary formation,

394
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,599
and then really perfect our models

395
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,479
and keep on observing. I mean, I I see

396
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,719
often this astronomy and science in

397
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,239
general, like you're putting pieces

398
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,479
of the puzzle together. Yeah. To get

399
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,399
that a really good view of the whole

400
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,759
picture. So, that's what we're

401
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,679
doing. I mean, and it's, that's

402
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,899
beautiful. So, thank you both so much

403
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,659
for such a great introduction to you

404
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,899
know, Webb's last year in Science and

405
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,899
we are already getting so many great

406
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,499
questions in online but I'm going to

407
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,339
take a step back. And I'm going to

408
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,179
toss it to our viewers. So, for those

409
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,939
watching, remember to send in your

410
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,979
questions using the# ask NASA or drop

411
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,419
them directly into the comment

412
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:08,699
stream wherever you're watching.

413
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:12,219
Alrighty. So, our first question is

414
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:14,619
from Instagram user, Trevor Morea.

415
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,219
So, he has a question about the

416
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:19,479
anniversary image. He asked this is a

417
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,359
is this is a multiphoto stacked on top

418
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,639
of each other of different

419
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,559
wavelengths of what each camera

420
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,599
sees, correct? Um this isn't what it

421
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,799
looks like to the naked eye

422
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,559
basically. It's what. Yeah. Yeah.

423
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,559
Yeah. Okay, take that one. Sure, go

424
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,519
ahead. So, we like by the way. Let's

425
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,919
let me demystify this. Okay. There's

426
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,159
really not pulling a fast one here. We

427
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,239
take, so this is all one camera. So,

428
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:46,199
the near cam instrument and with that

429
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,159
camera, we do two colors of light at

430
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,159
once. And we get a we get a buy one get

431
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,799
one free which is useful and so but

432
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,359
when you get the raw data and you can

433
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,839
download the raw data from from the

434
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,439
telescope You can go look this up for

435
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,079
yourself. The raw data are gray,

436
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,839
right? Where it's more light, less

437
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,999
light. It's monochrome but you can

438
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,839
look at the raw data and it looks a lot

439
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,399
like this. What we do to make these

440
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,399
really gorgeous images is we give

441
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,999
them, we give the data a spa

442
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,839
treatment, right? I mean, we make

443
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,679
them look their best. We clean them up

444
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,339
but they still look like themselves.

445
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,339
Mm hmm. We're not doing anything to

446
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,019
really change what's going on here.

447
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:27,579
We just kind of make it pop. Yeah. And

448
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,499
so what's in blush? Yeah, exactly.

449
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,819
There's a little bit of like but but

450
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,659
it's we're not, there's not, there's

451
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:35,339
nothing. You can look at the raw data

452
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,339
and see everything that you see in

453
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,979
this image. What we basically do is

454
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:43,179
assign colors that our eyes can see to

455
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:46,699
different colors of light that web is

456
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,099
detecting and so we try to do that in

457
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:51,739
ways that make physical sense. So, in

458
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,739
this case, we've assigned the yellow

459
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,459
color to to du

460
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:00,619
to a mission from smoke from little

461
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,939
pieces of smoke and so then we're

462
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:05,019
we're assigning red to molecular

463
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:08,139
hydrogen and so we can be flexible

464
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:09,579
because of course we can't see the

465
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,859
infrared. Yeah. But there's

466
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,219
something magical about our

467
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:14,459
eyeballs, right? My cat can see

468
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,939
further in the red than I can and bees

469
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,699
can see further in the blue than we

470
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:21,419
can. Telescopes allow us to see past

471
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,659
the limitations of our own eyes. And

472
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:26,539
then we map them into what we can see so

473
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,739
that we can make sense it because we go

474
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:31,539
through life in in color and so that,

475
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,299
you know, astronomers do that. When

476
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,059
we're, when we're analyzing images,

477
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:36,899
we make three-color images. Yes. So,

478
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,499
we can help see, okay, what am I

479
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:40,019
looking at here? What's going on?

480
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:43,059
Wow, I mean, that is just incredible

481
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,659
and you know, it really, I feel like,

482
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,659
brings out that merger of art and

483
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,179
science in a way. Definitely,

484
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,819
that's. And so, that's so cool. So, on

485
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:54,179
our next Twitter user asks, Reg

486
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,219
Victors, he's asking a question. If

487
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,979
the web telescope can look with such

488
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:01,299
detail at the very farthest reaches

489
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,339
of the universe, can it see with

490
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:06,819
extreme detail what is in our own

491
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,659
Milky Way Galaxy. Basically, if it

492
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:10,339
can look so far away, you know, does

493
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:11,459
that mean if it looks a little bit

494
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:13,539
closer, can it see with really,

495
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:15,779
really great detail and he has an

496
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,699
example, can it catalog solar

497
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,219
systems and the detailed

498
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:21,619
compositions of the body's orbiting

499
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:26,099
them? So, for, so, yes. So, I ask the

500
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,379
question, yes, certainly we can

501
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,859
study and we are studying our own

502
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:32,339
galaxy and actually this image was

503
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,399
released today or not, a galaxy. It's

504
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,039
a really close region. So, yes, we are

505
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,799
studying planetary system like

506
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,159
Travis. I mean, they are really far

507
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:43,679
away. So, what do we see with these

508
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,119
planets is maybe if you see the

509
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,799
planet, you see a dot. Mm hmm. You

510
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,999
don't see, you know, this beautiful

511
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,759
renditions that are more like art and

512
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,199
everything else but yes, we study

513
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:54,239
them. We do direct imaging. We do

514
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,039
a rainbow with a date and we had

515
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,159
rainbow. We get all the chemical

516
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,999
composition and we can characterize

517
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,639
them. So, so far, we are studying for

518
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:05,139
outer solar systems, let's say your

519
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:07,539
solar systems, the planets

520
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,299
themselves. Mm hmm. We have a start

521
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,859
yet doing any sort of other body there

522
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:14,419
but yes, we can certainly understudy

523
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,939
our own galaxy. Well, I mean, that

524
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:19,539
just leaves us excited for what's to

525
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:21,059
come. Right. You know, it's only the

526
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,219
first year. So, Astroza on YouTube

527
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:26,259
asks, will JWST try to find distant

528
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,979
quasars? Ooh. Yeah.

529
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,339
Yeah, we've already finished. Yes.

530
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:36,219
Uh in the first year, we we targeted

531
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:38,699
some Quasars we already knew about.

532
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:39,899
They were discovered by other

533
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,739
telescopes and there have been

534
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,819
recent results out studying those

535
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,659
quasars and in particular, wanting

536
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:47,259
to understand. So, these are

537
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:49,099
supermassive black holes. Aquasar

538
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:51,739
is a name for a black hole with the mass

539
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:55,819
of up to a billion with a B solar masses

540
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:58,459
worth of stuff. In a black hole that's

541
00:20:58,459 --> 00:20:59,819
about the size of our solar system.

542
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:02,459
Wow. That's at the heart of a galaxy.

543
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,679
Every galaxy has a supermassive

544
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,839
black hole in its center. Big

545
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,679
galaxies have big black holes, small

546
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,839
galaxies have small small decals.

547
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,319
Quays are a supermassive black hole.

548
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,479
Equasar is a good question. Equasar

549
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,239
is a supermassive black hole that is

550
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:20,039
feeding. That is a creeding gas down

551
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,079
onto it. Anything. Yeah. And so it's

552
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,759
fueling. It's getting bigger. Yeah.

553
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,679
And of course once matter falls into a

554
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,199
black hole, you'll, you know, it can

555
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,799
never escape. So, no, none of that

556
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,119
light gets back out but as gas is

557
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,419
falling down into the hole. It's

558
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,339
colliding with other gas and it glows

559
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:38,499
white hot and into the ultraviolet

560
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:40,659
and even in you get X rays and it can

561
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:42,259
outshine the host galaxy and that's

562
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,819
what we call a quasar. So. Yeah. In the

563
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:46,499
first year, web has been studying

564
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:48,739
some of the the galaxies that host

565
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:51,059
those quasars to understand how did

566
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,379
they grow so fast. How did they build a

567
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,699
billion solar masses in a billion

568
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,939
years down in the center? Webb has

569
00:21:57,939 --> 00:22:01,059
also been discovering supermassive

570
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,439
black holes creating black hole that

571
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,199
we didn't know about that are just

572
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,439
popping up all over some of these deep

573
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,959
fields where we stare at a blank

574
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,639
field. We find thousands of

575
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:12,479
galaxies, and some of those, you're

576
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,839
like, oh, that's, that's another,

577
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,599
that's a, that's a Quasar. There's

578
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,879
another Quasar. We've, they've been

579
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:19,199
popping up all over. And why are we so

580
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,719
interested in studying them?

581
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:25,359
Quasars, black holes. It's all part

582
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,639
of the galaxy pictures or part of the

583
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,479
pastel. So actually, you reminded me

584
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,419
with the you do have to the question to

585
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,939
be able to see the galaxy underneath

586
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:36,379
and there are techniques to do that

587
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:39,579
but it's all about stabbing the

588
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:41,579
galaxies and how they are form and and

589
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:44,299
evolve. Well, we have another

590
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,699
question from an a Twitter user,

591
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:50,459
radiocasterful, asks, could JWST

592
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,699
take a picture of Voyager One or is it

593
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:55,979
too small to pick up on camera? Well,

594
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,579
that's a good question. Alright, do

595
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:59,979
math on the fly. It's too small. It's

596
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,739
too small. I don't see it. Yeah. Yeah,

597
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,639
you but I love the question. Yeah.

598
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:05,079
Yeah, I know. That was an insightful

599
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,759
question. Thank you. I mean, I'd have

600
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,119
to actually do the math to work out

601
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,639
whether you can get the reflection

602
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,079
even if you can't resolve it and I

603
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,599
can't do that in my head. I'd have to go

604
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,759
get a pencil. Yeah, not go phone a

605
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,759
friend. Yup. Um well, we have Maddie

606
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,519
Lane on Twitter who asks, what

607
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,599
temperature does Web operate in in

608
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,279
deep space? Well, we have two range of

609
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,119
temperatures. So, we have three

610
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,479
instruments that operate in the near

611
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,879
referral and they are at about 40K

612
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:31,859
which is like a few tenths of grease

613
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:34,179
over the absolute serum and then we

614
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,939
have Miri that operates on the mini

615
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:39,139
infrared which means that you have to

616
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:40,979
be colder to be able to detect that

617
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,579
signal. So, media operates at about

618
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:45,139
seven K which is just seven degrees

619
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,459
above the absolute zero and that

620
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,979
means that Mary needs to have a

621
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:51,379
special cooling system. It's like it

622
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:53,379
has its own fridge so to say to keep it

623
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:54,899
cool and really make it functioning.

624
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:57,459
The other ones are cooled down by the

625
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:58,979
Sunshield that protects everything

626
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,139
from the radiation of the sun. While

627
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,799
the range is just. It it is. Yeah. It

628
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,479
is. And on the hot side. On the hot

629
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:07,159
side. Right? A hot side where the

630
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,719
below the so the telescope and the

631
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,079
science instruments all really

632
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,799
cold. What? Minus 400 Fahrenheit. 40

633
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,799
degrees above absolute zero. On the

634
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,079
hot side, it's like room temperature

635
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,559
and hotter. So, the the parts that

636
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,839
like, you know, where we keep the

637
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,399
computers and the radio, the phone's

638
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:25,399
home, all of that is nice and toasty

639
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,639
and then we have to keep that isolated

640
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,399
from the cold side where we're doing

641
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:32,419
the science. It's like of degrees

642
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:33,859
difference between the two sides.

643
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:35,859
It's really a fit. I mean and it's just

644
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:37,619
such a technological marvel, you

645
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:39,539
know, like no wonder it took 20, 000

646
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,779
people to do this. Really one of the

647
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,459
hardest parts of designing a

648
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:45,619
building web was separating those

649
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,299
two temperature zones. Very, you

650
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,699
know, quite hot and very very cold and

651
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,699
having the hot not bleed down into the

652
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,699
cold. I mean, this is all so

653
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:55,459
fascinating and to those watching,

654
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,459
thank you for such thoughtful

655
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,299
questions. It really is a blast

656
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:00,899
participating with you on today

657
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,359
show. So, keep sending in your

658
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,559
questions using the# ask NASA or by

659
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,159
dropping them directly into the

660
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,519
comment box wherever you're

661
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,439
watching today. We'll get to some of

662
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,959
the some more of those in just a few

663
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:14,959
minutes. Now, let's take a closer

664
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,199
look at the planets in our own solar

665
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:20,479
system. Web has shown us clouds and

666
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,039
storms on your Uranus and Neptune as

667
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,799
well as their ring systems which

668
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,879
appear to be way more prominent in

669
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:29,439
infrared light. Maca, what can we

670
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,179
learn from an image like this of

671
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:34,479
Neptune. This is a beautiful image

672
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,319
and actually we have not seen Neptune

673
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,639
talking about we didn't see these

674
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,879
rings, many of these rings since the

675
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:43,119
budgeter fly by in about, I think it

676
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,959
was nineteen eighty-nine. So, it's

677
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,639
been many years and. Yes. So, with

678
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,399
Web, we can really see engraved

679
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:51,039
detail all the rings. We can see seven

680
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,439
out of the 14 satellites around it and

681
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:55,519
we can see all these bright, shiny

682
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,359
spots and those are clouds in the

683
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,759
atmosphere that are made out of a

684
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,519
material, a type of gas that it's

685
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,419
really reflective in and that's what

686
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,899
we see then that bright. So with Web we

687
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,619
can see not only the but now there

688
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:10,379
there is more data not only the first

689
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:12,539
image so astronomers are looking for

690
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,219
more rings the satellites we didn't

691
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:17,739
see and maybe even more satellites so

692
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:19,339
there's a lot of activity going on and

693
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:20,779
of course at the core of it is like

694
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,099
studying those atmospheres, those

695
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:25,099
clouds, those storms, how how do they

696
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:26,699
move? How do what is the dynamic

697
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,539
around the planet and how do they

698
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:31,339
evolve essentially year after year.

699
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,179
So it's really one good welcome to

700
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,099
think, well, these are so close. Why

701
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,459
do you need such a powerful machine?

702
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:39,139
And the answer is because we need all

703
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,899
this detail. These are the closest

704
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,659
planets to us. So, it makes a lot of

705
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,259
sense to study them in detail and then

706
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:45,939
to think, well, how does this fit with

707
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,219
the exoplanets we talked about

708
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,939
before? And I can only imagine that

709
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:52,179
you know, the more detail we get, that

710
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,019
must inform missions and things like

711
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,779
that as well, right? So. Absolutely.

712
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:58,579
Exactly. Absolutely. And in part,

713
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:01,379
the as Maca said, the last time we got

714
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:04,399
an image of Neptune that that crisp.

715
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,639
We had to send a probe all the way to

716
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:08,879
Neptune. Yeah. Here, we're just, you

717
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,879
know, the web telescope is not that

718
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,879
far from the Earth. It's just pointed

719
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:15,039
out there and seeing and so it lets us

720
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,239
look at the outer solar system

721
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,839
without having to actually go there

722
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,319
and we're also, it also is informing

723
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,359
things like places where there is

724
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,799
activity in the outer solar system

725
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,359
like Encellidus, the moon of Saturn,

726
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,839
where where following up on

727
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,839
discoveries made by NASA's mission

728
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,259
Kissin which is now over with but now

729
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:38,139
we can go back and look and see, okay,

730
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:41,899
what was going on that Cassini saw and

731
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:43,579
follow up on it. Um so, that's

732
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,939
something I I think is one of the

733
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:46,379
neatest discoveries so far. Really

734
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,219
is. Has been the the water plumes

735
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:50,619
coming out of the moon in Celadus and

736
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,779
how there's this plume of water that

737
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:56,699
is escaping out of cracks in the icy

738
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:59,339
crust from what is presumably a

739
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:02,119
sub-surface ocean down there. And

740
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,959
we're seeing that escaped water and

741
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,359
so Webb has captured that and has

742
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,759
taken Spectra, little rainbows to

743
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,239
see what it's made of. So that was

744
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,999
something where we didn't have that

745
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,919
instrumentation on board Cassini

746
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,319
and but we could do it now after the

747
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,959
fact and we can visit all of the outer

748
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:22,599
planets and the the comets

749
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,639
asteroids, corporate vet objects

750
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:28,199
without having to send a probe. That

751
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,119
is incredible and so I do actually

752
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,199
what you said just reminded me we had a

753
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:34,679
few questions back. We asked I think

754
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,039
about Webb's temperature in deep

755
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:38,999
space. Uh huh. Web is not in deep is it?

756
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,959
So Web is about a million miles away

757
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,399
from. You would consider it is? Okay.

758
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,399
Yeah, it it is pretty far away. Yeah.

759
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:46,839
It's, yeah, I mean, it's four. Four

760
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,599
times past the distance of the moon.

761
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,199
It's further than humans have ever

762
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:51,799
gone. Exactly. Yeah. Right? But

763
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,239
compared to the distance of even

764
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:56,039
Jupiter, it's not that far. So, you

765
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,279
know, we say hi to it and it's like less

766
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,039
than a light second. It's not that far

767
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,919
away. I just scheme a thing. But it's

768
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:04,439
not like Hubble. Yeah. You know, when

769
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,879
Hubble is at its closest approach,

770
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:08,039
it's only 300 miles over your head,

771
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,859
right? Yeah. So, in that sense it's a

772
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:11,939
million miles away. Yeah. So, you

773
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:12,819
know, if we're going to talk about

774
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,819
range planets, we gotta talk about

775
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,699
Saturn. Yes. What has released an

776
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:20,099
incredible image of this planet and

777
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,499
so, other than just sheer beauty,

778
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:25,539
what could we, what can we learn from

779
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,019
this image? Sure. You want to take

780
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:29,619
that one? Sure. I mean, yes. So,

781
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:32,899
again, the solar system express they

782
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:35,139
call web, a ring machine because they

783
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,499
are seeing the rings of all these

784
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:38,819
planets I love it. Yeah, it's like a

785
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,699
rain machine. And so these rings are

786
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:44,579
made out of dust and ices and that is

787
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,899
where with infrared and wet web, you

788
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:48,339
can really see the details and you can

789
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:50,819
really understand other, you know,

790
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:52,259
what what are the satellites in the

791
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:53,779
rings, what is the composition, and

792
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:55,939
their dynamics, and other more rings

793
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:57,299
we don't see. For instance,

794
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,139
Enseladus is like a little bit

795
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:01,139
further away in a ring that is not the

796
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:02,659
typical rain you see in the images

797
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:05,139
from Saturn. So, again, lots of data,

798
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:07,699
lots of new information and really it

799
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:09,619
it's a fun fact is that the planets,

800
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:11,219
they're so bright that they

801
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:13,619
challenge with web is is not to get too

802
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:14,899
bright and then made the data

803
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:16,899
difficult to to observe. So, the

804
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,839
challenges is really get good

805
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,519
quality data in a really really short

806
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,119
time. Mm hmm. And that's what we're

807
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,039
doing. Well, I mean, it seems like

808
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,039
it's knocking it out of the park and so

809
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,119
before we move on from solar system, I

810
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,039
do want to ask, you know, Jane, are is

811
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,439
there any other object in the solar

812
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,039
system or anything else Webb has been

813
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,799
doing? Sure. In the past year. Oh,

814
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,039
gosh. We've been doing a lot. Um and

815
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,399
they don't have time to talk about all

816
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:41,399
the comets and asteroids. We've been

817
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,399
studying. I do want to mention one

818
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:46,999
asteroid that we observed when it was

819
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:49,379
hit another NASA mission, the Dart

820
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:52,099
Mission, which on purpose, slammed

821
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:55,299
into one of a pair of asteroids that

822
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,299
were orbiting each other in order to

823
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,539
measure, can we move an asteroid? If

824
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,299
we needed to do that for, to protect

825
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:03,059
our own planet. And so that was

826
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,739
something that was a real stretch for

827
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:07,139
our team. Webb was not built to track

828
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:08,899
an asteroid that's moving that fast,

829
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:10,659
that was three times past our speed

830
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:12,579
limit. But there's a lot of cool

831
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,099
science that we could do if we can

832
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:16,259
track objects moving that fast. And

833
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:18,079
so our team really pretty eager for

834
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,919
that challenge and embraced it and in

835
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,039
fact, we captured the the plume of

836
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,759
junk coming out of that asteroid as it

837
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,959
was hit by the dart by the dart

838
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,359
probe. So, that's pretty neat. Uh

839
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,439
technically, it also lets us study,

840
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:35,759
okay, what's what's going on in there

841
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:38,319
and are are they rubble piles? What

842
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,199
what is the composition of these so we

843
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,359
did Spectra. We took rainbows to see

844
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,519
what the stuff was that was coming off

845
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,739
this this a but I'm proud of the team

846
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,259
because I know how hard we work to get

847
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:50,779
that together to get that to work

848
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,379
because that thing was zooming fast

849
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:53,899
and we're like, you know, having to

850
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:55,499
move our telescope pretty fast. And

851
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:56,859
thanks to that, now, we can move the

852
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:58,379
telescope faster and we thought

853
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:00,459
about before launch. So, we can do

854
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:02,779
science of faster objects. That's

855
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:04,379
incredible. I mean, like, talk about

856
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:06,619
an all-star year for this telescope.

857
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:08,699
So, it really is amazing to see what

858
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:11,099
it's been accomplishing and there

859
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,539
are so many questions coming in

860
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,299
online. So, let's get to a few of them.

861
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:17,159
As a reminder, to tuning in live, you

862
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,479
can submit questions using the# ask

863
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,719
NASA or drop them into the comment

864
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:23,319
stream wherever you're watching the

865
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,719
show. We'd also love to know what has

866
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,399
been your favorite web image from the

867
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,639
past year. Post it online along with

868
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:32,279
your question using the# ask NASA.

869
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,239
Alright, our next question. Um

870
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,919
actually, this is a collective

871
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:38,839
question. So, we have a few viewers on

872
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,599
Twitter who want to know more about

873
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,919
the anniversary image. So, they're

874
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,499
asking is what we're seeing in this

875
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,379
image in the past. Yes. Yes. It is in

876
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:52,259
the past. Can you explain how? It is

877
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:56,259
390 ladiers away in the past. We

878
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,339
because that is the time the light

879
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:02,819
travel takes to travel to us. So, it is

880
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:04,339
in the past and actually everything

881
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:06,259
you see is in the mass. When you look at

882
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,859
yourself in a mirror, you're looking

883
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,379
at ourselves, yourself like it's

884
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:11,299
like a tiny fraction of of a second,

885
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:13,459
slightly younger than you are at that

886
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,299
moment. So, yeah, it's it's light

887
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,139
travel and of course, the universe

888
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,639
also expand so depending on where you

889
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,319
are, it might take a bit longer but

890
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,879
yes, everything we look with web is

891
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:28,199
older. Yeah. It's just. We're

892
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,559
looking. Yeah, but it's like the

893
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:31,319
light from the sun. It's a slight end

894
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,159
to the past. We are looking at each

895
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:34,519
other slightly into the past. It's

896
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,039
mind bonding, you know, to really

897
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,359
like sit and think about that And so,

898
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,119
actually, this is a great follow-up

899
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,959
question. Adam, up, up, dyke on

900
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,919
YouTube asks, has JWST changed our

901
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,719
perspective perception of the

902
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,799
universe And if so,

903
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:56,299
You know. Not yet. Dad, I'm going to

904
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,619
go for not yet on live. I mean, yes and

905
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,139
no, right? Like, it's gorgeous. It's

906
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,979
lovely but we we kind of knew that.

907
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:05,899
We're in like this this is going to

908
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:07,579
knock people's socks off, right? I

909
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,259
know. Remember having to reassure

910
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:10,939
reporters before launch about,

911
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:12,299
well, are the images going to be as

912
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:14,859
good as Hubbles? Let me just wait. Sit

913
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:15,979
back. No, don't worry. It's not

914
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:18,539
going to be a problem. Um I would say

915
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,219
that you know, we are still getting

916
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,379
started and I would say that so far,

917
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,439
from me anyway.

918
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,199
What has given me confidence is that,

919
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,479
you know, the data that we've gotten

920
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,479
so far tells us, oh yeah, this is

921
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,879
working great. Mm hmm. This is, in

922
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,239
fact, we can push harder than we

923
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,879
thought and so far, I think that we

924
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,879
have, we, we know that we can push

925
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,679
quite a bit harder. Yeah. It maybe the

926
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,919
we'll get to it but I think the the high

927
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,919
red shift, the very very most distant

928
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,599
galaxies where we're looking back in

929
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,839
time not just a hundred or thousand or

930
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,279
million years but we're looking back

931
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:58,479
in time 13 billion years. Years. For

932
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,999
me, that probably the part where

933
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:02,319
that's changed my perspective just

934
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:04,239
because for me and for everybody

935
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,399
else, before launch, that was a big

936
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,639
old question mark. What did the first

937
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,319
billion years of the universe's

938
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,919
history look like? Nobody really

939
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:14,079
knew and that's the one area where

940
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,119
we've gone from saying, oh, we we just

941
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,039
can't we can't do that with any

942
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,359
telescope we have. We just hit a a

943
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,919
cliff. where it's like it's you, we,

944
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:26,719
we can't see that far back in time to

945
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,999
where, oh yeah, we're finding

946
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,679
hundreds of these galaxies.

947
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,599
Everywhere we look and that's the

948
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,959
part where we've gone from saying,

949
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,959
how did it all get started? How did the

950
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,239
galaxies form from well we don't know

951
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,039
to, okay, now we have lots of data and

952
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,319
we're really starting to figure out

953
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:44,159
how quickly galaxies got their act

954
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,599
together. I feel like, you know, that

955
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,279
only probably opens up more

956
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:51,599
questions, right? So. But I think

957
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,519
it's given us new information in

958
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,839
every area. That really informing

959
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,279
everything. So, I have a great

960
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:58,959
follow-up to that. You know, Web is

961
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:01,199
again, knocking it out the park and

962
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,199
so, we have a few people asking, what

963
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:05,679
was the original life expectancy for

964
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,879
Webb? Yes. Um and has it changed

965
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,479
after this first year. So, like I said

966
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:14,239
that? Yeah. So, before launch, the

967
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,239
life expectancy. So, the

968
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,079
requirement was five years. Mm hmm.

969
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,199
Before launch, with a fuel on board

970
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,719
set there up with, we thought it would

971
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,719
be 10 years. In launch, during

972
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,399
launch, the launch was so optimized

973
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,479
and so well done that we did save a lot

974
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:32,719
of fuel. So now, if we think we had to

975
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,479
think about the limiting life factor

976
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:36,719
essentially, if you think fuel, then

977
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,719
it will last 20 years or more but we

978
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,079
don't know exactly what will be the

979
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,939
limit and how everything will evol Do

980
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:44,059
you want to follow up? That's

981
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:47,419
perfect. So, fingers crossed. So,

982
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:50,219
that it is. That it is the 20 years. Um

983
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:52,939
so, we have another collective. Uh

984
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:55,499
several users on YouTube are asking

985
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:57,339
if Web has found life on other

986
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:58,779
planets. Now, from what I

987
00:36:58,779 --> 00:36:59,899
understand, this is not a

988
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:02,459
life-seeking mission. You know, and

989
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:04,699
but that web looks for bio

990
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:07,659
signatures. Uh huh. Um could you tell

991
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,059
us more about that? So, the answer is

992
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,679
no. We have not found life on other

993
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,439
planets. Yes. We'll let you know if

994
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,359
that happens. Yes. Nor was web

995
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,919
designed to do that. Yeah. That is a

996
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,839
job for a future telescope. And in

997
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,839
fact we are working on that. There's a

998
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:24,839
design, they're starting to design

999
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,199
something called the habitable

1000
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,119
worlds observatory which would do

1001
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,199
exactly that. Uses a lot of the same

1002
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:32,999
technology as web. It looks, you

1003
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:35,319
know, it has hexagons, it deploys, it

1004
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,079
it but it it looks at at the same light

1005
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,439
that we do, visible, and then

1006
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:42,579
ultraviolet light Webb can't do

1007
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:44,019
that. It's an infrared telescope.

1008
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:44,739
There's just some basic

1009
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:47,219
limitations. We're not going to find

1010
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:49,779
life. And it and it's not looking for

1011
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:51,539
signs of life. Not right. That is not

1012
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,379
our science case. Mm hmm. So we could

1013
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:56,739
do is find places with web. We can we

1014
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,739
may be able if they're out there and

1015
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:00,819
they're close to find planets that

1016
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:03,299
could be habitable. That look nice

1017
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:06,099
and toasty but not too hot. Yeah. They

1018
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:09,299
have liquid water. But we it what Web

1019
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:12,079
cannot do is say yes that has life on

1020
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,239
it. Mm hmm. That is a job for a future

1021
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,079
mission. They can say this looks like

1022
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,639
a nice designated nation that life

1023
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,959
might want to vacation. To study. To

1024
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,199
study in the future. Yes and so. Okay.

1025
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:25,759
Thank you for that. Okay. So, we just

1026
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:28,559
we just asked viewers to share their

1027
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,479
favorite image in the chat and now

1028
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,639
Chalkstar on Twitter wants to know.

1029
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,199
Oh, this is a good one. After a year,

1030
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,759
what is your favorite image from

1031
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:41,499
JWST? I must say, I'm with today's

1032
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:43,979
image. Oh. Really? Before that, it

1033
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:45,739
was a Stefan's quintet. Okay. With

1034
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:48,139
Miri. Uh huh. Uh but I have to say the

1035
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:50,219
image from today, it is mind blowing

1036
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:53,099
to me. It's Athro. It is exactly. It's

1037
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,579
so it's organic and it's like

1038
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,419
beautiful. And the one before was

1039
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,059
Stephan Squintet with me. What is

1040
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,219
that? Okay. I'm going to go with

1041
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:05,259
Pandora's cluster. Oh. Which is

1042
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:08,539
a galaxy cluster. So, thousands of

1043
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:11,799
galaxies crammed into a space that in

1044
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:13,479
our neck of the woods is just a couple

1045
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:17,239
galaxies. Um it is so that's probably

1046
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,919
my favorite. The other one I really

1047
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:22,119
love is S Maxo 723, which is the lens

1048
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,799
and cluster that we revealed a year

1049
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:26,599
ago. Yeah. Uh just because for that

1050
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,719
one it was so beautiful and it's it's

1051
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,399
also the science that I do. So, I was

1052
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,759
like, well, this is exciting and it

1053
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,999
was also really easy. We got those

1054
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,239
data. We started the telescopes are

1055
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,679
observing around midnight. We had

1056
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,979
the data by breakfast. It was just one

1057
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:44,179
of these like, oh, oh, okay, this is,

1058
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:46,339
this, it's working really well. So,

1059
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:48,179
that one is a special place for me just

1060
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,499
because it was a demonstration to the

1061
00:39:50,499 --> 00:39:53,619
world of how just of how

1062
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:56,099
transformative this telescope is.

1063
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,059
Wow. If I may add, Stefan Suente, just

1064
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,139
to add context, it's very much where

1065
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:02,899
you have a group of galaxies that are

1066
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:05,139
interacting and you really see how

1067
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:07,219
they they have like this cosmic dance

1068
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,299
and they sort of distort each other

1069
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:10,979
and in that process, you know, they

1070
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:12,819
may form a new galaxy. Definitely,

1071
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:14,659
they may form new stars. So, it is.

1072
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,619
Beautiful. I mean, thank you both too

1073
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:18,659
and I know that you all look at these

1074
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:20,979
images all the time and so like it

1075
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:22,499
really is incredible to hear which

1076
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:24,819
ones are y'all's favorite. Um so, our

1077
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,099
next question comes from mister

1078
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,059
Spaquito on Twitter who I know that's

1079
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,579
it. Like it. It's a good one. That's a

1080
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,739
good handle. Um how much time do the

1081
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:35,939
teams at STSCI and NASA take to

1082
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:39,139
publish webs data? So, starting from

1083
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:41,539
observing from the telescope. Uh

1084
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,899
huh. And then going through the whole

1085
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,439
process of analyzing and render them

1086
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:48,799
out and then publishing. So, what's

1087
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,559
the timeline? So, the the time lamp,

1088
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,639
it depends, right? So, first of all,

1089
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,119
STSCI and and and NASA S institutions

1090
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,919
don't publish data like there are

1091
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,759
scientists. Mm hmm. That do paraceta

1092
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:01,679
but the way it goes, you take your data

1093
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:03,919
and then it gets down linked. We have

1094
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,239
done banks twice a day. Uh so, it gets

1095
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,839
downloaded essentially and then it

1096
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,359
goes through what we call a

1097
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,879
calibration pipeline which is what

1098
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:12,399
Jane was describing before. You

1099
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:13,999
know, get rid of your electronic

1100
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:15,519
effects and the things you don't want

1101
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:17,279
from the data and that is automatic

1102
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:19,599
and that is done at STSEA. Then, once

1103
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,359
that process is finished negative

1104
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,559
goes into the archive and then the

1105
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,479
investigator team graphs the data

1106
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,239
and they may say oh I'm going to fine

1107
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,439
tune this, I'm going to fine tune

1108
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:31,119
that and then they have to analyze it

1109
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,119
and do their science. So it can be

1110
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,399
anytime from I've seen papers coming

1111
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:38,639
out in literally 2 days. Another

1112
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,359
stake maybe 6 months. Six months a

1113
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,639
year. A year. It really happens.

1114
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,519
Yeah. Wow. Well, thank you both so

1115
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:47,039
much for these answers to these

1116
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,719
questions. For those watching at

1117
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,779
home, we'll get back to some more

1118
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:52,299
questions in just a few minutes so

1119
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:54,699
keep sending them in. So, we've now

1120
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:55,979
looked at our own solar system,

1121
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:58,619
right? Let's go back in time. Yes. To

1122
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,179
win the first galaxies we're

1123
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:03,419
forming. Web is a powerful time

1124
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:05,979
machine with infrared vision that is

1125
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:10,219
peering back over 13. 5 billion years

1126
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:13,099
and is already providing the first

1127
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:15,499
look at the earliest galaxies that

1128
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,419
formed hundreds of millions of years

1129
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:20,599
after the big bank. So, Again, we're

1130
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,839
hearing a lot about Webb being a time

1131
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,679
machine of sorts. Maka, could you

1132
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,919
explain how telescopes can even be

1133
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,519
time machines? Yes, and this is nice

1134
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,039
feeling with the question we had

1135
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,879
before about in the past. So, light is

1136
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:36,599
a wave. and it travels. So, we know it

1137
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,119
takes time to travel and travels at

1138
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,719
the speed of light. So, when the first

1139
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,639
galaxies and stars, they emitted

1140
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,799
their life thirteen and a half or more

1141
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:45,399
billion years ago. That light

1142
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,959
started to travel in time and space

1143
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:50,519
and I did travel in a universe that is

1144
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:52,359
just expanding and in that

1145
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:55,079
expansion, that wave gets stretched

1146
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:57,319
and stretching in the most for

1147
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:59,079
instance from the visible light to

1148
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,839
the infrared light it gets weather.

1149
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,599
And that's where web can catch it.

1150
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,279
It's really it's really a beautiful

1151
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:08,599
process. So we are looking at a time of

1152
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,119
the universe. We have never looked at

1153
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,159
before. With havel we looked until

1154
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,879
about 13 and and a little bit billion

1155
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:17,559
years ago. We there were other

1156
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:19,559
missions that looked even like

1157
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:22,039
behind the the the like W map and Kobe.

1158
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:24,679
That that time were the first

1159
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:27,079
galaxies and the stars were formed.

1160
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:28,819
It new illustration of what we're

1161
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:29,939
looking at. We're literally looking

1162
00:43:29,939 --> 00:43:32,099
at the edge of what Habel did and and

1163
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,339
really pushing forward the limits.

1164
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:36,899
So, it's that's how it is at a machine.

1165
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:39,939
It's mine. It's honestly mind

1166
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:42,739
blowing and so, you know, Jane, but

1167
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:45,539
how can we really know how far away any

1168
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,699
given galaxy is with so much

1169
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:50,419
accuracy? Sure, it's so convenient

1170
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:53,779
that. So, we take rainbows is the

1171
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:55,939
short answer and very conveniently,

1172
00:43:55,939 --> 00:43:58,419
there are little markers, little

1173
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,819
diagnostic kind of like if you think

1174
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:02,899
about like CSI, forensics. Yeah.

1175
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:04,659
There's little fingerprints of what

1176
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:06,499
different elements and molecules

1177
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:09,219
are that just stand out and you can

1178
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:11,059
say, oh, that's oxygen, That's

1179
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,339
carbon, that's hydrogen and

1180
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:14,019
anywhere it is in the universe, you

1181
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,859
get these little little spectral

1182
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:17,619
signatures in the rainbow and you

1183
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:18,979
say, well, that's that's hydrogen.

1184
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:20,979
There we go and so, it's really

1185
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:24,019
helpful that those signatures are

1186
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:26,819
there in galaxies but as Maca said

1187
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,079
because the light has been red

1188
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,759
shifted because of the expansion of

1189
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:31,839
the universe. All we need to do is say,

1190
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,759
oh, there's hydrogen. I measure what

1191
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:36,399
color I see it at. I know what color it

1192
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:38,399
was originally. That means, I know

1193
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:40,559
how far, how much universities has

1194
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:42,159
been stretched as that light was

1195
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,399
traveling to us. So, it lets us take

1196
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,399
what we measure which is a red shift

1197
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:48,799
and then, we use a cosmological model

1198
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:51,199
to turn that into a distance. So, what

1199
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,879
it basically means is we get little

1200
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:55,599
rainbows of all our galaxies. We then

1201
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,659
can figure out distances to everyone

1202
00:44:57,659 --> 00:44:59,579
in their galaxies and so if you think

1203
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,899
of like the I'd take a a deep field like

1204
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,419
the famous Hubble Deep Field where

1205
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:05,339
we've got hundreds of galaxies all

1206
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:07,499
peppered over an image. Getting

1207
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,339
these little red shifts means that we

1208
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,739
can we can make that into a three D.

1209
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:13,499
Right? It's not a flat image anymore.

1210
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:15,979
We can do. Yeah. We know the pains,

1211
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,179
right? We can say, okay, this

1212
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:18,859
galaxies, These these are the ones.

1213
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:21,259
These far away. And we can we can start

1214
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:23,819
making a 3D model of where everything

1215
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:26,359
is. That means we can start okay,

1216
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:27,959
these galaxies we're seeing as they

1217
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,279
look 13 billion years ago. These

1218
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:32,599
galaxies are as they lurk 13. 4

1219
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,599
billion years ago. These galaxies

1220
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,759
are 10 billion years ago and so for any

1221
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:38,679
galaxy we look at, we get a snapshot.

1222
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:40,439
We don't live long enough to see

1223
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:42,439
galaxies evolve. We just don't live

1224
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,999
love enough. But we can by getting all

1225
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:47,639
these snapshots put together that

1226
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:50,279
that picture of how galaxies evolve

1227
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:52,359
with time. It's as though we never got

1228
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:55,079
to see humans age but we got snapshots

1229
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:57,699
of at different stages of their lives

1230
00:45:57,699 --> 00:45:59,619
and from that, we can piece together

1231
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:02,099
how people are born. Oh, I love that.

1232
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,899
Mature And and get old. Yes. That is a

1233
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:07,699
great analogy. So, you know, what is

1234
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:11,299
Webb revealing now that we could have

1235
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:12,899
never known a year ago, right?

1236
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,119
Can I do that one? Sure. Go ahead. Yes.

1237
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,079
So, the big result. So, there are a lot

1238
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,439
of results for the early universe.

1239
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,199
They're coming out fast and furious.

1240
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,799
Yes. So, the ones that I think that

1241
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:27,359
sort of to kind of group them into some

1242
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,599
big themes. Yeah. So far, we're

1243
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:30,799
learning that there are more

1244
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:33,119
galaxies at early times in the very

1245
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,359
young universe than we expected.

1246
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:38,239
That's cool. They're also brighter

1247
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:39,999
than we expected so they're easier to

1248
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:42,319
study. Great. There's lots of them.

1249
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,319
What we think is going on and we're

1250
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,559
getting Spectra of them and we're

1251
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:48,559
finding So, what we're finding is

1252
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,679
that galaxies formed earlier than we

1253
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,239
thought and they are forming more

1254
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,159
stars than we kind of gave them

1255
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,919
credit for or or thought. Wow. We

1256
00:46:57,919 --> 00:46:59,679
might optimistically get. Yeah. We

1257
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,039
didn't really know. Honestly, we had

1258
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:02,799
huge uncertainties in what we might

1259
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:04,799
get in this first billion years. This

1260
00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:06,239
really was a, well, that's why we

1261
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,839
built the telescope. Yes. To go find

1262
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,839
out. But the main result that is

1263
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,999
emerging is that there are more of

1264
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,359
these galaxies. They're brighter

1265
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,679
than we expected. I, my

1266
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:17,659
interpretation that is the galaxies

1267
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:20,139
just got organized early. We're

1268
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:22,379
still working out why. What's the

1269
00:47:22,379 --> 00:47:25,819
details Yeah. Cities. So there,

1270
00:47:25,819 --> 00:47:27,339
these are all still very small

1271
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:29,259
galaxies compared to the Milky Way.

1272
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:31,579
Both in terms of size and in terms of

1273
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:33,819
mass. But they have a lot of the

1274
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:35,419
properties of bigger later

1275
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,899
galaxies. They've made some I'm kind

1276
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:39,019
of proud of them. They've gotten

1277
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:40,379
their act together. They've formed

1278
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:41,739
black holes in their centers.

1279
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:43,419
They're they're creating gas.

1280
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:45,419
They're forming stars. So that's a

1281
00:47:45,419 --> 00:47:47,579
little okay. These processes that we

1282
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:49,979
see in the the nearby universe are

1283
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:51,739
working in that first billion years.

1284
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:54,459
And so we're understanding how we're

1285
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:56,939
really getting a a gorgeous view of

1286
00:47:56,939 --> 00:48:00,539
how galaxies turned on and got

1287
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:02,939
organized in the very early universe

1288
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:05,819
which was the science case that sold

1289
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,499
the telescope. That's why we built

1290
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:09,819
it. And interestingly some of them

1291
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:12,779
they we know now they have stopped

1292
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,499
subformation. Well there it is.

1293
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:16,939
They're taking a break. They're

1294
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:19,419
taking a break. And maybe maybe some

1295
00:48:19,419 --> 00:48:21,339
of them will start merging with her

1296
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:22,779
neighbors and really triggering

1297
00:48:22,779 --> 00:48:24,539
stuff formation again. So maybe the

1298
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:25,899
black hole did it. Don't know yet.

1299
00:48:25,899 --> 00:48:27,919
David we don't know That's a neat

1300
00:48:27,919 --> 00:48:30,079
result. Yeah. Exactly and that is how

1301
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,159
Galaxy is will evolve until today.

1302
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:35,039
Wow. So, let's get to some more

1303
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,879
questions from our viewers. But

1304
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:39,119
first, we want to know where have you

1305
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,799
seen web images over the past year?

1306
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:42,239
With the mission's incredible

1307
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,719
window into the universe, I mean, we

1308
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:46,719
have seen pictures on clothing,

1309
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:50,399
billboards, and Times Square. Where

1310
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:52,479
have you seen Web? Drop your response

1311
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,079
into the stream wherever you're

1312
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,559
watching. Alright, so now, on to some

1313
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,519
next questions. We have some users

1314
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,239
who are asking more about how we apply

1315
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,039
colors to the black and white photos

1316
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:07,679
that we get from web. Um could you go

1317
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,199
into a little bit more detail? Yup. I

1318
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,199
gotta tell you about it. So, Ajay was

1319
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,999
planning before Every instrument

1320
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:16,639
has a camera. Let's we call them

1321
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:18,159
detective. It's like a camera. Hm.

1322
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,599
Talking about images and what the

1323
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,039
cameras detect, they do detect

1324
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,919
photos, they take light and in this

1325
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,119
case, we use filters to select which

1326
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,099
part of the infrared light if it was

1327
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,619
visible, you could use a blue filter

1328
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:31,819
and then you're going to get all the

1329
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:33,819
blue photons. It's similar. You use a

1330
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:35,099
filter in the infrared that you get

1331
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:37,099
those specific photos. So, you take

1332
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,779
maybe three, four, five different

1333
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:41,819
filters and then you order the

1334
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:43,499
chromatically. So, your blue

1335
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:45,579
filters, you assign them the blue

1336
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:48,539
color on the visible. For the weather

1337
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:50,379
filters, you sign the red color and

1338
00:49:50,379 --> 00:49:52,459
then in between. So, that's what the

1339
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,779
imaging expert score chromatic

1340
00:49:54,779 --> 00:49:56,619
order. So, they assign to each

1341
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:59,719
infrared that we cannot see, a color

1342
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:01,239
that we can see, and it's literally

1343
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,679
just one by one and then they combine

1344
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:06,199
them and in that process of

1345
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:08,279
combination is that space where you

1346
00:50:08,279 --> 00:50:09,959
mentioned before that there's also

1347
00:50:09,959 --> 00:50:11,879
art in this. Yeah. Because you know,

1348
00:50:11,879 --> 00:50:14,039
they really do this fine tuning of

1349
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:16,199
optimize this. What is more pleasing

1350
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,199
to the eye and they come up with this

1351
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:20,199
really beautifully highly

1352
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:21,879
contrasted image. It's what each of

1353
00:50:21,879 --> 00:50:24,279
the colors, it's real and each of the

1354
00:50:24,279 --> 00:50:25,719
colors represents something. One

1355
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:27,159
will represent us, the other

1356
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:28,919
molecular hetrogen, the other

1357
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,819
oxygen. It so it is in there and it

1358
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:33,499
really gives a scientific meaning to

1359
00:50:33,499 --> 00:50:35,819
the image. I mean, you know the phrase

1360
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,779
like a photo is worth a thousand words

1361
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:41,259
or something. Web is really doing

1362
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:43,259
this right now, right? Like, not only

1363
00:50:43,259 --> 00:50:44,619
is it beautiful. You're just

1364
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:46,619
learning so much about the universe

1365
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,139
and just the connection of

1366
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:50,379
everything. So, thank you for that

1367
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:52,619
wonderful description. We have

1368
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:55,739
another great handle. Uh huh. Tofu

1369
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:58,779
eating cat on Twitter asks, a great

1370
00:50:58,779 --> 00:51:00,619
question. Um are there any

1371
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:02,139
opportunities for citizen

1372
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:04,379
community science with web data?

1373
00:51:04,379 --> 00:51:06,939
Sure. That's a good question So,

1374
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,459
first, I should say what Citizen

1375
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:12,299
Science is. Um that is efforts that

1376
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:16,299
are efforts to get real interesting

1377
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:20,779
investigations that are done by

1378
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:23,179
large groups of people in the

1379
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:24,539
community who are not trained

1380
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,739
scientists and there have been

1381
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:28,219
wonderful examples of this in all

1382
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,699
fields of science, ornithology, in

1383
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:34,859
astronomy, and so for Webb, we are

1384
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,659
still actually working on figuring

1385
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:39,639
out how do we want to what our

1386
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:42,519
strategy for that should be All of the

1387
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:46,119
data go public. Some of them have a one

1388
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:49,479
year period where they're secret

1389
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:51,479
except to the team that propose that

1390
00:51:51,479 --> 00:51:53,639
data but after that year, they all go

1391
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:55,479
public. So, we have a rich archive

1392
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,719
that anyone can access. Yes. And it

1393
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:59,799
really is fun. It just start zooming

1394
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:02,599
around and start playing with the

1395
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:04,999
data yourself. You don't need to be an

1396
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:08,179
expert to start wrestling with and

1397
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:10,099
and making the same face that

1398
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:13,579
astronomers make which is Where? You

1399
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:14,859
know, the face as we're, you know,

1400
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:16,619
dealing with the real data. Yeah. So,

1401
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,619
that's the the short. So, so we're

1402
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:19,979
working on it. Yeah. If you have

1403
00:52:19,979 --> 00:52:21,739
ideas, let us know because that's

1404
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,059
something of for the future. Yeah,

1405
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,739
thank you and so for those actually

1406
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:27,419
interested in Citizen Science at

1407
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:29,632
NASA, you can visit Citizen Science.

1408
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:31,979
NASA. gov and explore some of our

1409
00:52:31,979 --> 00:52:34,219
projects there as well while we keep

1410
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:36,139
our fingers crossed for maybe one in

1411
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:38,939
the future with Webb one day. So, we

1412
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:41,259
have Twitter user, Christine Kuga,

1413
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:43,979
who asks, just how deep in the

1414
00:52:43,979 --> 00:52:46,139
universe can web see as opposed to

1415
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:47,739
Hubble? So, I guess, can we get a

1416
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:49,899
little compar and on their

1417
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:52,059
distances. Maca. Yeah. Yeah. I mean

1418
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:54,859
high ball was what? Thirteen point 2 3

1419
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:57,579
billion years ago. And Webb is going

1420
00:52:57,579 --> 00:53:00,779
13. 5 and beyond. So it's

1421
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:04,059
what it feels like a small window when

1422
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:05,659
you think of the number but it's

1423
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:07,339
really huge. Cuz in terms of

1424
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:09,099
evolution of the universe and in

1425
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:10,379
terms of what's happened there.

1426
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:13,339
Because that first billion years a

1427
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:15,499
lot was all did happen. Exactly. From

1428
00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:17,099
you know. Getting organized.

1429
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,919
Getting organized Exactly. Get all

1430
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:20,839
your stars together. One of the

1431
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:22,359
results that's been so gratifying

1432
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:24,519
for me has been to see that with

1433
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:26,439
Hubble, we really could just look at

1434
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:28,119
the colors. Mm hmm. And say, well,

1435
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:30,599
that's the right color red to be one of

1436
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:32,279
those very distant galaxies. Cuz

1437
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:34,199
it's visible light. Well, right? Or.

1438
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:35,959
And just we could we couldn't take

1439
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:37,239
Spectra. We couldn't get the

1440
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:38,599
rainbows. You could just get the

1441
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:40,679
colors and a couple filters. With

1442
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,999
Web, we can get beautiful rainbows

1443
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:44,999
and in fact, we can get rainbows for

1444
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:48,019
dozens of galaxies at the same time.

1445
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:50,019
Cuz the near spec instrument can do

1446
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,939
has this neat multiplexing. I want

1447
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:53,059
that one, that one, that one, that

1448
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:54,979
one, that one all at the same time. And

1449
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:57,059
so with web, we're not only saying,

1450
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,979
yes, I know exactly how far away each

1451
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:01,139
of these galaxies is. But I know what

1452
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:03,059
they're made of, right? There's the

1453
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:04,899
hydrogen, there's my oxygen, why is

1454
00:54:04,899 --> 00:54:06,579
there so much nitrogen in that one?

1455
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:08,659
Yeah. Which has been a puzzle in some

1456
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:10,259
of these, right? We're getting we're

1457
00:54:10,259 --> 00:54:11,219
getting both very familiar

1458
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:13,299
diagnostics and some that were like,

1459
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:14,979
oh, I'm not seeing that before.

1460
00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:17,839
What's different about these early

1461
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,559
galaxies compared to galaxies in the

1462
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,399
universe today. So, really good

1463
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:24,479
follow up to that. Um Twitter user,

1464
00:54:24,479 --> 00:54:27,199
Aerospatial, is asking if Web needs

1465
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,439
to take a pause after each image,

1466
00:54:29,439 --> 00:54:31,919
essentially, is it true that web is

1467
00:54:31,919 --> 00:54:34,319
always observing, always operating

1468
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,239
twenty-four 7. It is always

1469
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,719
operating. I mean, you take an image,

1470
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:42,159
you take a post, say to switch your

1471
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:44,239
filter or switch your selection of of

1472
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,919
your of your rainbow and then take

1473
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:47,819
another and then you're finished so

1474
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:52,139
the data for your say and then then the

1475
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:53,579
telescope has to move to the next

1476
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:55,899
target. So while it moves, typically

1477
00:54:55,899 --> 00:54:58,059
it wouldn't get data from the sky but

1478
00:54:58,059 --> 00:54:59,739
it can get some calibration data and

1479
00:54:59,739 --> 00:55:01,739
then it goes to the next target. So, it

1480
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:03,179
is essentially observing all the

1481
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:05,579
time except when we do particular

1482
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:08,299
like uploading a new software or

1483
00:55:08,299 --> 00:55:09,899
taking specific engineering data

1484
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:12,139
for, you know, processing and

1485
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:13,499
understanding how things are going.

1486
00:55:13,499 --> 00:55:15,659
But yeah, it is, I wouldn't say

1487
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:17,079
twenty-four there are little poses

1488
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:18,439
in between and then you have to get

1489
00:55:18,439 --> 00:55:19,879
there to your target but usually when

1490
00:55:19,879 --> 00:55:21,399
you go to a region of the sky, you

1491
00:55:21,399 --> 00:55:23,639
optimize it and you do all the targets

1492
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:24,839
that are planned for that particular

1493
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:26,679
region. Safe to say it's working

1494
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:28,519
overtime. Yeah. Well, it is, yeah.

1495
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:30,039
It's just constantly. Yeah.

1496
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,199
Constantly taking data. And every

1497
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:34,119
week, we give it a new plan for the next

1498
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:36,279
week and we schedule a week out and

1499
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:39,239
twice a day, we say hi and. I'm good.

1500
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,999
Download all the data that it's taken

1501
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:45,079
in the last half of the day. It keeps

1502
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:46,979
obser keeps going. It's very, yeah,

1503
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:49,059
very efficient. Ah. The telescope

1504
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:50,899
that could, you know? So, we are

1505
00:55:50,899 --> 00:55:53,059
running out of time but I do have one

1506
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,299
final question. You know, what's

1507
00:55:55,299 --> 00:55:57,939
next? What's next for Webb? Sure. So,

1508
00:55:58,539 --> 00:56:01,499
We are exactly one year into our

1509
00:56:01,499 --> 00:56:04,379
science mission. We have selected

1510
00:56:04,379 --> 00:56:06,939
the science for year two. That

1511
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,539
science just started. We started

1512
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,259
observing that July 1st and right now

1513
00:56:11,259 --> 00:56:13,259
we're doing a mix of finishing the

1514
00:56:13,259 --> 00:56:14,939
targets that we hadn't gotten to yet

1515
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,739
from the first year and starting the

1516
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,339
targets from the second year. We'll

1517
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:21,099
do a mix of that. The first year will

1518
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:23,019
ramp down as the second year ramps up.

1519
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:25,979
We have we're about to ask the world.

1520
00:56:25,979 --> 00:56:27,419
Alright y'all what are your best

1521
00:56:27,419 --> 00:56:29,339
ideas for year three? We're going to

1522
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:32,779
ask that for a deadline in the fall.

1523
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:35,819
And really just keeping it coming.

1524
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:38,139
And I think that one of the the things

1525
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:39,899
I'm really gratified to see is that

1526
00:56:39,899 --> 00:56:42,139
the the easy stuff came out in the

1527
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:44,139
first couple months. And now we're

1528
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:45,419
starting to see the papers that

1529
00:56:45,419 --> 00:56:47,339
really took some analysis with the

1530
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,579
harder analysis. Which gets the more

1531
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,179
interesting results. So I think our

1532
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:52,699
big results are still ahead of us.

1533
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:55,499
That is so exciting to think about

1534
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,979
too. And thank you so much Doctor

1535
00:56:57,979 --> 00:57:01,019
Rigby, Doctor Marin, for taking us

1536
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:02,779
through this journey of Webb's first

1537
00:57:02,779 --> 00:57:04,699
year of science. I mean I think it's

1538
00:57:04,699 --> 00:57:06,939
safe to say that the best is even yet to

1539
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:09,339
come. So yeah. We really appreciate

1540
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:11,179
having you here today. Thank you so

1541
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,699
much. Really a pleasure being here

1542
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:14,939
and sharing this celebration with

1543
00:57:14,939 --> 00:57:17,339
everyone. Yes. Fantastic. And thank

1544
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:19,019
you and thanks to folks who've been

1545
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,779
with us on that journey and you know

1546
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:22,379
stay with us. It's there's more to

1547
00:57:22,379 --> 00:57:24,859
come. Yep. And thank you to everyone

1548
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:27,499
tuning in online. I mean I love that we

1549
00:57:27,499 --> 00:57:29,339
were able to answer so many questions

1550
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:31,339
and we really hope that you'll keep

1551
00:57:31,339 --> 00:57:32,859
following the mission as web

1552
00:57:32,859 --> 00:57:35,499
continues to peel back the curtain to

1553
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:37,899
the mysteries of the cosmos. To stay

this enough. This is just the

1561
00:57:54,439 --> 00:57:56,439
beginning. Webb's first year of

1562
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,439
Science is an amazing start to what

1563
00:57:58,439 --> 00:58:00,759
this observatory will continue to do

1564
00:58:00,759 --> 00:58:02,599
as it transforms our understanding

1565
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,879
of the universe. To go more in depth on
